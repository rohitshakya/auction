            <h3>What is Reverse Auction?</h3>
            <p>
                Reverse auction is a unique concept where buyers post their requirements, and sellers compete to win the buyer's business by offering increasingly competitive bids. Unlike traditional auctions where buyers bid higher amounts to win an item, in reverse auctions, sellers bid lower prices to win the buyer's project or order. This creates a competitive environment that drives down prices and ensures the best value for buyers.
